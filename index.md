Hi, my name is Amira Veldman-Wilson and I am a student at the University of Connecticut. I am in my senior year with a major in Chemistry and a minor in Astrophysics. I will be graduating from the University of Connecticut in the spring of 2026. I have a current GPA of 3.61 and I am applying to graduate schools.

About Me
I have been gaining hands-on experienece in chemistry labs at the University as I have been conducting research in a chemistry researchh group. I work under Dr. Jing Zhao as an analytical/physical chemist where I synthesize colloidial gold nanoparticles and study the effects different ligands have when attached to the surface. I have learned skills in programs such as MATLAB and Origin graphing to help interpret data for the experiements I conduct. 

I have help author a paper on "Scaling Integrated Chemical Sensor Arrays Using Pico-Drop Technology for Electronic Nose Applications" where I created differing samples of gold nanaoparticles that had differing ligands functionalized on the surface to help conduct sensors based on a signal given by different solvents.

Feel free to reach out with any questions or comments.
