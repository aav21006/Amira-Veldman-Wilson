Hi, my name is **Amira Veldman-Wilson** and I am a student at the **University of Connecticut**. I am in my senior year with a **major in Chemistry** and a **minor in Astrophysics**. I will be graduating from the University of Connecticut in the spring of 2026. I have a current **GPA of 3.61** and I am applying to graduate schools.

## About Me:
I have been gaining hands-on experienece in chemistry labs at the University as I have been conducting research in a chemistry researchh group. I work under **Dr. Jing Zhao** as an **analytical/physical chemist**. What I have learned/do:
- Synthesize colloidial gold nanoparticles.
- Study the effects different ligands have when attached to the surface.
- Learned skills in programs such as MATLAB and Origin graphing to help interpret data for the experiements I conduct.

I have helped author a paper on **"Scaling Integrated Chemical Sensor Arrays Using Pico-Drop Technology for Electronic Nose Applications"** where I created differing samples of gold nanaoparticles that had differing ligands functionalized on the surface to help conduct sensors based on a signal given by different solvents.

Feel free to reach out with any questions or comments.
